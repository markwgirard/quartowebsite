## About me

I’m a mathematician and quantum computing researcher. I'm currently hold the title of Quantum Algorithm Developer at Photonic Inc., where I've been since April 2023. 

I earned a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Calgary (2017), where I researched applications of convex analysis to quantum information theory (specifically entanglement theory) under the supervision of Gilad Gour. Afterward I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo (2017-2020) under the supervision of John Watrous, and a lecturer in the Mathematics department until 2021.

I enjoy mathematical challenges! I have recently gotten into solving 538’s Riddlers and started compiling my solutions here.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, homebrewing beer, tabletop games, and various outdoor activities (hiking, camping, climbing, skiing, snowshoeing).

Research
When I was still in academia, my research interests centred around solving mathematical problems motivated by questions in quantum information theory. I primarily made use of convex analysis, convex optimization, linear algebra, matrix analysis, and operator algebras to tackle questions related to the theory of quantum entanglement.

See a list of my publications here and more details of my research here.

On this site I keep a list of [my publications](papers), [presentations](talks), 
and [my CV](cv.pdf), as well as a [technical blog](blog.html).


## Miscellaneous
Teaching I’ve taught numerous courses during my time as an academic.

Lecture notes and problem solutions TeX’ed up lecture notes and solutions to problem sets of the courses that I took during my graduate studies. You can see the list of courses here.
